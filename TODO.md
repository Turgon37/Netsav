## Todo
  1. A package for easy install
  2. A stack for keep event that have not been trigged to retrig them later
  3. Implement a method to allow the main thread to kill subthread properly
  4. A function to downgrade the netsav deamon right if it is run as root
  5. Allow a reference host to be used to check connection, if it is not available, notification about other ost availability will not be generated
  6. Store trigger event in a queue and use the server thread to handle them instead of each client thread handling
